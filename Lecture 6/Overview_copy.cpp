// Taken overview on binary to decimal conversion
// and Dcimal to binary conversion
// 1's complement
//  like steps
//  (1)=> convert it in binary form
//  (2)=> prefix with a zero(0)
//  (3)=> 1's complement reverse the given binary form like 101 is there so 1's complement will be 010.
//  (4)=>add+1 like
//  010
//   +1

// Verify that reverse process
// Steps
// (1)=> 1's complement => means reverse them as in upper we do
// (2)=>add +1 as upper we have done

// Note if (010) first zero comes that means that it is minus number is there.
